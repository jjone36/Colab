# Grow Like Groot!
: *Intensice coding challenge for machine learning*

<br>

## ***1. Coding Challenge***
This project has the purpose of imporving practical skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence. After finishing the deep learning sepcialization, I decided to start **coding-centered** studying. The goal of this project is to make 100 notes for reading and learning from other people's code on Kaggle or Github. It'll defintely be a huge challenge yet is expected to bring a huge growth in my skills. Just like groot.
